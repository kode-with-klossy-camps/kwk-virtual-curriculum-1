## General Camp Resources

  <h3 class="solo-day-label solo-day-click">Day in the Life</h3>
  <div class="solo-day-toggle">
    <p>This table details a typical day-in-the-life at camps. These times align with the time zone that your camp is slotted to. While the vast majority of camps will follow this general structure, some camps may have slight adjustments in timing.</p>

<article class="solo-day-card">
  <h3 class="solo-day-label solo-day-click">Speaker Series</h3>
  <div class="solo-day-toggle">
    <p>Every Wednesday during camps, we will ask you to hold 12-1pm ET for the Kode With Klossy x Techsetters Speaker Series! These incredible conversations, moderated by Jenny and Sam, hosts of the Techsetters podcast, will highlight incredible women in STEM and are an incredible way for the entire community to come together on one Zoom to experience this together. We will send Zoom links and details in the #general slack channel but encourage you to share details (both of the speaker and of the event) with scholars to ensure they attend. We've also found it powerful if instructors include a debrief or reflection of the speaker series in that day's closing circle. There are often some special guests during this time üôÇ</p>

<article class="solo-day-card">
  <h3 class="solo-day-label solo-day-click">Content Capture</h3>
  <div class="solo-day-toggle">
    <p>The content captured during camps helps us tell the Kode With Klossy story for the rest of the year. While all the sessions are recorded on Zoom, the real community experience is shown through the in-between, organic moments. We‚Äôll provide you with a Google Drive folder to upload any pictures, TikToks, videos, or screenshots that you take throughout your session. You can also hold your scholars accountable for sending their own captured content, and should designate an IA to serve as the content liaison.</p>
    <p>In advance of your camp, we will send some guidelines for good moments to capture, including culture of tech, brain breaks, and¬†organic moments, such as scholars hyping each other up, or laughing, or generally being a community. </p>

<article class="solo-day-card">
  <h3 class="solo-day-label solo-day-click">Mentors</h3>
  <div class="solo-day-toggle">
    <p>We have some incredible engineers and technologists in the Kode With Klossy extended network who are excited to provide support and mentorship to scholars this summer. We have partnered with companies like IBM and others to provide mentors into many camps for scholars. These mentors will join your Pitch Parties on Day 6 and Demo Days on Day 10. Their role will be to provide feedback and encouragement on pitches and then see the evolution during work time on Days 8 and 9 (optional for them to join during project work time) and return on Day 10 to see final projects presented. A list of mentors that will join your camp will be provided to you by the end of the first week of camp. Kode With Klossy will communicate all Zoom details to mentors so you don't have to. We encourage you to allow all mentors to introduce themselves at the beginning of the Pitch Party so scholars know who is in the room.</p>
