## Practice in repl.it

Follow the directions in the repl.it project below to get some practice with accessing elements, changing text and CSS, and event listeners!

You can either type your code and run it in the browser here, or click the “open in repl” button in the top right corner of the repl below to open it in another tab and see it full-page.
