Applying what you've learned about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, then pushing yourself to do some problem-solving and research, you are going to build a virtual instrument!

### Must-Haves

- A set of buttons, probably in varying colors
- A sound that plays when each button is clicked or hovered over

### Tips

- You will need to utilize the HTML `<audio>` element
- jQuery does not play nice with the `<audio>` element; you will have to use vanilla JavaScript. Remember, anytime we use `$` in our JavaScript and some other methods like `.on` for event listeners, that is jQuery. You'll have to google how to do the same things in vanilla JavaScript.
- A good resource for mp3 files is <a target="blank" href="http://soundbible.com/free-sound-effects-1.html">SoundBible</a>.

Here's a screenshot of an example:

## Iteration 1 - Wireframe & Vision

- Draw out your vision for the way your Instrument will look - on a desktop, iPad size, and phone size
- Like we did with the Twitter card, label each section with the HTML element that will be used
- Find your inspiration! Find any images, color, fonts, etc. that you want to use. Jot this information down in your notebook, a GoogleDoc or in comments in a Repl

**Notice:** you haven't written any code in Repl yet. The planning process is extremely important and professional developers spend a lot of time in this phase.

## Iteration 2 - HTML & CSS

- Write the code necessary to get your instrument looking the way you want it to

## Iteration 3 - Research and Pseudo-Code

- Research `<audio>` and play around with it, either in a file in Atom or a Repl.

- Psuedocode or whiteboard the JavaScript that will need to be in place to make your timer work.
  - What DOM elements will you need to manipulate?
  - How will you do this with vanilla JavaScript?

## Iteration 4 - Sound!

- Bring your instrument to life - get the audio working when each button is clicked on or hovered over!
