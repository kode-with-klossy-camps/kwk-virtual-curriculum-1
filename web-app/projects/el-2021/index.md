[Back to Projects]({{ site.url }}/web-app/projects)

**Estée Lauder is looking to YOU** to design and build an app best viewed on mobile devices to help promote their new "Double Wear Stay in Place" product line. Here are the parameters:
- Follow the [Mobile First Design](https://www.justinmind.com/blog/complete-guide-to-mobile-first-design/#:~:text=What%20is%20mobile%20first%20design,experience%20to%20the%20right%20device) strategy to design and build this challenge. While we want to start with the mobile design, it's also a goal that the app looks great on a laptop or desktop, as well. The [Responsive Design Extension Lesson](https://kodewithklossy.github.io/kwk-virtual-curriculum/web-app/lessons/css-extension-responsive-design/) may be a helpful resource for you! However, you may write your code in a way that does not require breakpoints and media queries.
- Use the photo assets provided by the Estée team - [they can be found here](). You can use them all or choose a subset of them to use on your app!
- Decide on a color palette. Here are a few great resources:
  - [Color Hunt](https://colorhunt.co/)
  - [Coolers](https://coolors.co/)
  - [Color Picker](https://htmlcolorcodes.com/color-picker/)
- Build in at least one feature to differentiate from a Photo Gallery project, and differentiate it from what others may submit. Get creative! Remember, the goal is to help _promote this line of products_. How can you get your users excited about this line? 
- Think carefully about the design decisions you make. You'll be asked to share your rationale for those decision by reflecting on some questions in the submission form.

Not only will this give you great practice as you continue to develop your skills with HTML & CSS and responsive design, your work may be featured on Estée Lauders blog! Details on submissions are below.

### Submission

Here's how it will work:
- Submit your repl.it project links and responses to a few questions about your inspiration and process using [this Google Form](https://forms.gle/6gmfFEKSnG3UhWDy7). 
- Submission deadline: Wednesday evening your second week of camp at 8pm local time

Karlie and the Estée Lauder team can't wait to see what you submit!
