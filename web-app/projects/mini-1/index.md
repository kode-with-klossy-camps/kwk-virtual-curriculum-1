Applying what you've learned about HTML and CSS, you are going to build a little "About Me" site! This gives you both a chance to practice your skills, as well as get to know your fellow scholars! Over the course of camp, we'll share these with each other!

### Must-Haves

- Your name
- An image of something that represents you and your passions
- A link to something you are interested in
- At least 3 facts about you
- Use of color

### Tips

Fork [this repl.it project](https://repl.it/@kodewithklossy/mini-project-1) and use as a starter. Have fun! We ask that you spend about 30 minutes on this.

## Iteration 1 - Rough Draft

In your notebook, first jot down what information you want to share on your About Me site. Draft that all up, so when it's time to code, you don't have to think of what that content will be.

## Iteration 2 - HTML

Get that content on the page in appropriate HTML tags!

## Iteration 3 - CSS

Add some colors, borders, and anything else! As camp progresses, you'll learn more and more about CSS and can always revisit this site and add on to it.
