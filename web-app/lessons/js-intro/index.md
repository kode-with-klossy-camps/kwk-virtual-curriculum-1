## üê£ Warm Up

In your breakout room, have the person with the longest hair share their screen. Play <a target="blank" href="https://flag-fest.herokuapp.com/flag-fest">Flag Fest</a> as a small group. Choose any region you'd like!

## üåé What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is the language of the internet. It is commonly confused with <a target="blank" href="https://www.seguetech.com/java-vs-javascript-difference/">Java</a>, but they are two very different languages. As of now, we can build great looking websites, but they don't _do_ much. JavaScript is what allows our pages to be dynamic - show your name in the top corner to indicate you are signed in, change information on the screen based on what you type in a form, etc.

If we compare a web app to a human body, we can think of HTML as a skeleton, CSS as clothes and accessories, and **JavaScript as the muscle**.

<div class="try-it">
  <h2>üê£ Discuss</h2>
  <p>Think back to Flag Fest that you played in the Warm Up, and feel free to reference it while answering these questions with the same small group.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>What are some of the HTML elements that were probably used?</li>
    <li>What are some of the things the site <strong>does</strong>?</li>
    <li><strong>When</strong> do things change on the page?</li>
  </ul>
</div>

Takeaways:
- Some of the behaviors of the site: it starts a game, plays a game, gives the score and feedback on which flag the user correctly selected
- Behaviors all happen after the user has interacted - clicking the button to start a game, make guesses, play again, etc.

## Data Types

Throughout camp, you will learn about several different **data types** in JavaScript. A data type is a specific kind of information or data. Based on the type of data we write in our code, the program will interpret it differently. In this lesson, we will learn about Strings and Numbers.

## Strings

A string is a primitive JavaScript data type. You can think of a string as a series of characters (alpha, numeric, spaces, and special characters) between two quotation marks, like so:

```js
'hello, world!'

"Hi, Kode With Klossy!"

"‚ú® üé© üêá üíñ"
```

In JavaScript, strings can be double-quoted (‚Äúlike this‚Äù), single-quoted (‚Äòlike this‚Äô), or back-ticked (\`like this\`). We'll talk more about the back-ticks later.

## `console.log()`

Right now, we can see the strings we type in when we hit enter. However, we won‚Äôt always be writing our code in the console, so let‚Äôs move to a more realistic way of writing our JavaScript.

**In the editor**, type the following:

```js
console.log('hello, world!');
```

You should see "hello, world!" appear in the console. This isn‚Äôt super exciting right now, but we will build on it.

<div class="try-it">
  <h2>Try It: Strings</h2>
  <p>On the left-hand side of the repl.it interface, type <code class="try-it-code">console.log("your first name");</code>. Instead of the words "your first name", type your actual name! You <strong>do</strong> need to include the quotes.</p>
  <p>Type <code class="try-it-code">console.log("your age");</code>.</p>
  <p>Type <code class="try-it-code">console.log("your full name");</code>.</p>
  <p>Type anything you want inside of the <code class="try-it-code">()</code> after <code class="try-it-code">console.log</code>- try to use some characters from your keyboard that are not numbers or letters. Make sure your text is enclosed in quotes.</p>
  <p>Don't forget to run your code by clicking the green play button (or using the keyboard shortcut <code class="try-it-code">cmd + enter</code>).</p>
</div>

Takeaways:
- Strings can hold any type of character, including spaces
- The way we type a string will be the exact way a computer sees it (it won't assume we meant to capitalize that first letter, catch if we misspell something, etc.)

## Variables

In most programming languages, including JavaScript, values can be saved to variables. Unlike in math class, where we would use x or y and a number, variables in programming are much more flexible. Below are three variables used in the Flag Fest game:

```js
var region = "Africa";
var activeAmount = "ten";
var flag = "Senegal";
```

To define a variable, we use the `var` keyword, followed by an arbitrary name we choose for the variable. Notice that all of the variables start with a lowercase letter. If you are selecting a variable name that has two words, make the first letter of the second word uppercase. This pattern is called camelCase.

After naming the variable, we use the `=` sign to show what value the variable will hold. In programming, we refer to the `=` as the **assignment operator** rather than the _equals sign_. It's still frequently called the _equals sign_, though, so you'll hear it, and people will know what you are referring to if you use that terminology.

We can now print any of these variables we have defined out to the console. The example below defines three variables, but only one will be logged to the console.

```js
var region = "Africa";
var activeAmount = "ten";
var flag = "Senegal";

console.log(region);
//=> "Africa"
```

<div class="try-it">
  <h2>Try It: Strings and Variables</h2>
  <p>Complete the following in a repl. You should type your code on the left-hand side of the page, run the code, and then see the results on the right-hand side of the page.</p>
  <p>Declare a variable for each prompt below. Then, print it out to the console.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A variable called <code class="try-it-code">favoriteColor</code> that holds your favorite color</li>
    <li>A variable called <code class="try-it-code">pet</code> that holds the name of a pet</li>
    <li>A variable called <code class="try-it-code">friend</code> that holds the name of a friend</li>
    <li>A variable called <code class="try-it-code">goal</code> that holds one of your 2021 goals. <em>Remember, you <strong>can</strong> include spaces in a string!</em></li>
    <li>A variable called <code class="try-it-code">hobby</code> that holds one of your hobbies</li>
  </ul>
</div>

### Re-assigning Variables

Sometimes in life, things change! We might change our names, move cities, our ages will almost definitely change, etc. In Flag Fest, the user can change the region that the game displays during a round. When they do that, the program may need to re-assign the `region` variable to a different string.

JavaScript gives us the ability to re-assign a variable so that its value can change. Here is the syntax:

```js
// The line below declares the variable region and assigns it to "Africa"
var region = "Africa";
console.log(region);
//=> "Africa"


// The line below re-assigns the variable region to "Americas"
region = "Americas";
console.log(region);
//=> "Americas"
```

Notice that when we **re-assign** a variable, we do not use the keyword `var`.

### Interpolation

We can also include variable data in a sentence. This is called **interpolation**:

```js
var region = "Africa";
var activeAmount = "ten";
var flag = "Senegal";

console.log(`The first flag from ${region} is ${flag}.`);
//=> The first flag from Africa is Senegal.
```

Make sure to use the back-ticks when you are using string interpolation (image below); it will _not_ work with regular single or double-quotes.

<div class="try-it">
  <h2>Try It: Interpolation</h2>
  <p>Complete this challenge in a repl. You can continue working in the same file as before, or choose to create a new one.</p>
  <p>If you have the strings "Karlie" and "Kloss" in the following variables:</p>
  <pre>
  var first = "Karlie"
  var last = "Kloss"</pre>
  <p>Use string interpolation to complete the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>What code can you write to output the string "KarlieKloss"?</li>
    <li>What code can you write to output the string "KlossKarlie"?</li>
    <li>What code can you write to output the string "Karlie Kloss"?</li>
    <li>What code can you write to output the string "Kloss Karlie Kloss Karlie"?</li>
    <li>What code can you write to output the string "I love Karlie"?</li>
  </ul>
</div>

## Numbers

Numbers are another primitive JavaScript data type. Like we saw with strings above, we can also store numbers in variables.

```js
var points = 0;
var maximumPoints = 10;
```

We can also re-assign variables that store numbers. In Flag Fest, this is how the program keeps track of how many times the user answered correctly.

```js
var points = 0;
console.log(points);
//=> 0

// The line below re-assigns points to its previous value (0) plus 1.
points = points + 1;
console.log(points);
//=> 1

// The line below re-assigns points to its previous value (1) plus 1.
// It is a shortcut that does the exact thing as the example above!
// You will sometimes hear these shortcuts referred to as 'syntactic sugar' üç≠
points += 1;
console.log(points);
//=> 2
```

<div class="try-it">
  <h2>Think About It</h2>
  <p>Incrementing numbers like what we just looked at above is something developers do very frequently.</p>
  <p>Brainstorm some examples of numbers incrementing in real apps that you use. Be ready to share what you brainstormed!</p>
</div>

Takeaways:
- On a users birthday, an app should increment their age
- Social media apps use incrementing to keep track of the number of likes, replies, followers, etc.
- Apps that involve scheduling - calendar events, flights, live video classes, etc. usually have a countdown timer to keep the user informed on the amount of time until something will happen
<br>

<div class="practice">
  <h2>ü¶Ñ Pro Tip</h2>
  <p>Have you noticed that sometimes lines of code in example are greyed out and start with two forward slashes <code class="practice-code">//</code>?</p>
  <p><strong>Comments</strong> are a way we can take notes in plain english, or use snippets of code that aren't complete. They appear in a shade less obvious than most lines of code and will not be read by the interpreter!</p>
  <p>To write a comment in your JavaScript code, start the line with two forward slashes <code class="practice-code">//</code>.</p>
  <p>Or, you can use a keyboard shortcut: <code class="practice-code">cmd + /</code> on your Mac, or <code class="practice-code">ctrl + /</code> on your PC!</p>
</div>

Again, as we did with strings, we can **interpolate** with variables that hold numbers.

```js
var region = "Africa";
var points = 7;

console.log(`Your score for ${region} is ${points}/10.`);
//=> "Your score for Africa is 7/10."
```

We can do math with numbers in JavaScript! The same math operators you're used to from math-class work here.

```js
3 + 5
//=> 8

12 / 2
//=> 6

18 - 8
//=> 10
```

We can also use parenthesis, and the Order of Operation rule applies here as well.

```js
(3 + 2) * 8
// 5 * 8
//=> 40
```

We can also use math on variables if those variables hold numbers.

```js
var name = "Karlie";
var tinsOfKookies = 1200;
var mealsDonatedPerTin = 10;

var mealsDonated = tinsOfKookies * mealsDonatedPerTin;

console.log(mealsDonated);
//=> 12,000

console.log(`Because ${tinsOfKookies} tins of kookies were purchased during Fashion's Night Out, ${mealsDonated} meals were donated to starving children all over the world. Thanks, ${name}!`);
//=> "Because 1200 tins of kookies were purchased during Fashion's Night Out, 12,000 meals were donated to starving children all over the world. Thanks, Karlie!"
```

<div class="try-it">
  <h2>Try It: Numbers & Operators</h2>
  <p>Start with these numbers:</p>
  <pre>
  var a = 12;
  var b = 65;
  var c = 31;
  var d = 98;</pre>
  <p>Write code to find the average of the four numbers above.</p>
  <br>

  <div class="challenge-container medium-heat">
    <p class="spicy-click">Click here for a Medium Challenge üå∂üå∂</p>
    <div class="spicy-toggle">
      <p>Find the answer to this problem using JavaScript: On average, there are 23.5 scholars at each Kode With Klossy camp this year. If there are 36 camps taking place, about how many scholars are attending in total? Print out to the console your answer in a complete sentence.</p>

You've now seen and used the foundations of JavaScript and all programming languages. Complete the exercises below to get a little more practice.

<div class="practice">
  <h2>Practice</h2>
  <p>Either working in the same repl file or a new one, complete the challenge below!</p>
  <p>Declare three variables: <code class="practice-code">username</code>, <code class="practice-code">caption</code>, <code class="practice-code">numberOfLikes</code>, and <code class="practice-code">numberOfComments</code>. Assign each variable to an appropriate value.</p>
  <p>Print out a sentence to the console using at least two of the variables.</p>
  <p>Now, re-assign the number of likes to a number greater than what it was initially assigned to.</p>
  <p>Print out a sentence to the console that includes the <code class="practice-code">caption</code> and <code class="practice-code">numberOfLikes</code>.</p>

  <div class="challenge-container medium-heat">
    <p class="spicy-click">Click here for a Medium Challenge üå∂üå∂</p>
    <div class="spicy-toggle">
      <p>Declare at least 5 variables that store information about you! Some possibilities are <code class="medium-code">favoriteColor</code>, <code class="medium-code">gradeLevel</code>, or <code class="medium-code">favoriteFood</code>. Assign them to appropriate values. Use interpolation to print out a sentence about yourself using all 5+ variables!</p>
