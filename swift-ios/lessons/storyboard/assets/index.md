## üåé Xcode Projects

Up until now, we've mainly worked in repl.it, which is a great place to run code, but not usable to build real iOS apps. _Xcode Projects_ is a place where we can! A lot more than writing code goes into building an iOS app, but we can do it all in Xcode. It is a big challenge that utilizes a lot of different tools; so we will take it one step at a time. [Here's]({{ site.url }}/swift-ios/lessons/storyboard/assets/xcode-map.png) a map of the main features in Xcode.

One of your camp instructors or IAs can screenshare and show you some of the features in action at this time!
